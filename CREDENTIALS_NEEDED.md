## 💡 Important Notes

### **Sandbox vs Live**

**Sandbox (Recommended for now):**
- ✅ Free testing
- ✅ Test cards available
- ✅ No real money involved
- ✅ Perfect for development

**Live (When ready):**
- ⚠️ Requires KYC approval
- ⚠️ Real money transactions
- ⚠️ Need business verification
- ⚠️ Takes 1-3 days for approval

### **Security**

- 🔒 Your credentials will be stored securely in `.env` file
- 🔒 `.env` file is gitignored (not uploaded to GitHub)
- 🔒 Never share your Secret Key publicly
- 🔒 Use different credentials for Sandbox and Live

```

Secret Key: YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
